# SpaceRat
This is the second genereation of my fully opensource Spacemouse called SpaceRat. With the help of this you can navigate in your 3D CAD software along 5 axis. 
The Arduino code is at the moment programmed to Thinkercad settings in Fusion360. This can be easily modified according to any of the used CAD software like, Blender, Solidworks etc..

NOTE: This is still a work in progress project!!!
